## Features

- Fancy styles.
- A button to reset the board and play again.
- A new win algorithm that allows for a dynamic number of rows, columns, and the number of symbols that you need to get in a line to win. Note that changing this actually breaks the game, but its fun to see it work!
- User can change some of the settings, including the number of rows and columns.
- Each player's score is shown above the board.
- The winning squares are highlighted green when the game is over.
- A message is shown telling the user when the game is tied.
- The multiple undo buttons for each turn have been replaced with a single undo button.
- Components and styles have been separated into their own files.
- The `Square` component was removed (unnecessary, replaced with a styled `Button`).
