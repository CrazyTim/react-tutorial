# Tic Tac Toe

Learning React and having fun with the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

View the [live build](https://crazytim.github.io/tic-tac-toe).

## Getting Started

Install Node.js, clone this repo, then run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Features Added After Completing The Tutorial

- Make it look fancier with fonts and stuff.
- Add a button to reset the board and play again.
- Write a new win algorithm that allows for any number of rows/columns, and any number of symbols that you need to get in a line to win (changing it will break the game, but its fun to see it work!)
- Provide inputs so user can change the number of row/columns, etc.
- Show each player's running score.
- Highlight the winning squares green.
- Display a message when the game is a draw.
- Show a single undo button, instead of one for each turn.
- Separate components and styles into their own files.
- Remove the square component (unnecessary, replace with a button).
