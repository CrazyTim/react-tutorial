Having fun with the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

View the [live version](https://crazytim.github.io/react-tutorial).

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Install Git and Node.js, then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/CrazyTim/reactjs-tutorial
cd reactjs-tutorial
npm install
npm start
```

## Features Added After Completing The Tutorial

- Make it look fancy
- Add a button to reset the board and play again
- Write a new win algorithm that allows for any number of rows/columns, and any number of symbols that you need to get in a line to win (changing it will break the game, but its fun to see it work!).
- Show each player's running score
- Highlight the winning squares green
- Display a message when the game is a draw
- Show a single undo button, instead of one for each turn
- Separate Components and styles into their own files
- Replace the Square component with a Button (unnecessary)
