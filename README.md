Having fun doing the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

View the [live version](https://crazytim.github.io/reactjs-tutorial).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Improvements

After completing the tutorial, I added some improvements...

- Fancier CSS
- Button to reset the board and play again
- Allow for a variable number of rows/columns
- Allow for a variable number of symbols you need to get in a line to win
- A new win algorithm
- Show each player's running score
- Highlight the winning squares
- Display a message about the result being a draw

## To Do

- Single undo button, instead of one for each move
- Split react components into their own files
